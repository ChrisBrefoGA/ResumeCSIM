For my version of this project I used a 2D array of structures. My structures are a set structure with just an array of my block structure, and my block structure has the tag, valid, and the time. When observing the outputs of my no-prefetch and with-prefetch I noticed that the with-prefetch, depending on size, significantly decreases the amount of reads and writes, and increases the amount of hits. I believe this happens because whenever we encounter a read-miss or write-miss while runnning with-prefetch we are forced to acquire another tag and put it in the cache along with the original tag that missed. Doing this allows us to have a tag in the cache already, and if another address happens to have the same tag it will give us a hit because it's already in there.
